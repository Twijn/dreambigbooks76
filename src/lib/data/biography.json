      "biography": "Mariann is a wife, mother and grandmother who worked as a Registered Nurse for thirty years. During those thirty years her love for American history grew stronger and she would tell anyone who would listen an anecdotal fact regarding an event in American history. You would be surprised how many times an occurrence on the nursing unit could relate to an event in history. She never let that opportunity slip by much to the exasperation of her co-workers. After becoming a grandmother, she continued to nourish her grand childrenâ€™s minds with love for country and American history by telling them stories, turning the stories into historical fiction tales that both she and the children enjoyed. Mariann and her husband frequently visit American history sites every year taking the children and grandchildren in tow. Mariann is a proud member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She loves living in the country and enjoys gardening, reading and boating."
